# How to STUDY so FAST it feels like CHEATING - The Angry Explainer

### Sugar

Before a test, don't eat candy. According to a UCLA study in 2008, too much sugar
can negatively affect your brain by slowing it down. Instead of candy, eat nuts,
fish, or berries before a test. Those foods boost your focus and memory.

#### TL;DR

Don't eat candy before a test.

### Mindset

When studying, use a good mindset. If you start studying thinking it will be
boring, it will be boring. But, if you don't be so negative and decide it will be
quick and easy, time will fly! There's even a Harvard study that employees that
believed more physical work helps have lower blood pressure and weight loss too!

#### TL;DR

Believe what you want to happen.

### Prioritizing

When studying, prioritize things! If you just spend your time learning useless
facts, you will(and that's a statement) fail the test. This is where the 80/20
rule comes in, 20% of the topics will give you 80% of the answers.

#### TL;DR

Prioritize important things.

### Focus on your Achilles Heal

Stop spending time getting better at something if you COMPLETELY SUCK at
something else! That's gonna lower your grade because if you study on the other
thing you get at least a better score. Start implementing horizontal learning,
where you actually use patterns in your brain, stupid.
Don't think that 1/20 score is enough for a job, you chungus.

#### TL;DR

Study more on your weaknesses.

### Memorizing

To memorize something, read it 10 times, say it 10 times, then write it 2 times.
It works pretty well!
